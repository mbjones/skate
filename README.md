Skate
=====
A simple registration database for tracking class enrollments and managing payments for Figure skating classes.

This project was built for the Juneau Skating Club to manage class enrollments, memberships, and other details of managing a figure skating club.  It may be useful for other clubs, but will need modification to adapt it to these other various needs.
